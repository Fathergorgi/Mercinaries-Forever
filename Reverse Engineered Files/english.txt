Background
Son of Alexei Voronov (ref #D394-DF70), a highly placed member of the "Russian Mafia" crime syndicate. Sergei inherited the family business at age 17 after his father and older brother were killed during an internal power struggle.

With Sergei at its head, the Voronov family's holdings have rapidly declined. Intelligence indicates that Sergei's future with the Russian mafia depends largely on his success in exploiting the situation in North Korea. 

Activities
Runs the North Korean black market. Also involved in numerous racketeering operations, including theft, extortion, narcotics, forgery, and smuggling. Operations center in Pyongyang doubles as a nightclub catering to military personnel.

Location/Area of Operation
Primary operations center is located in East Pyongyang. The North Korean black market is run through an on-line site (http://www.menace.ru) -- please contact your field support technician for more information.

Resources
The Russian Mafia relies on local resources, including looted/stolen military vehicles from all sides of the current conflict. They may also have access to Soviet military hardware that has been smuggled over the border.

If you make the Russians unhappy, though, you'll be locked out of the shop until you smooth things over.

Also, if you need some quick cash or want to improve your Mafia status, the chop-shop next to their headquarters is always open. They'll buy any vehicle that you bring in.BIN_H

Nationality: Russian

Background
Son of Alexei Voronov (ref #D394-DF70), a highly placed member of the "Russian Mafia" crime syndicate. Sergei inherited the family business at age 17 after his father and older brother were killed during an internal power struggle.

With Sergei at its head, the Voronov family's holdings have rapidly declined. Intelligence indicates that Sergei's future with the Russian mafia depends largely on his success in exploiting the situation in North Korea. 

Activities
Runs the North Korean black market. Also involved in numerous racketeering operations, including theft, extortion, narcotics, forgery, and smuggling. Operations center in Pyongyang doubles as a nightclub catering to military personnel.

Location/Area of Operation
Primary operations center is located in East Pyongyang. The North Korean black market is run through an on-line site (http://www.menace.ru) -- please contact your field support technician for more information.

Resources
The Russian Mafia relies on local resources, including looted/stolen military vehicles from all sides of the current conflict. They may also have access to Soviet military hardware that has been smuggled over the border.

DATA: Looks like you passed Sergei's test--you've been granted access to the Russian Mafia's web shop. If you tab over to the SHOP page in your PDA you'll see a list of items that you can order from the web shop. The Russians charge a lot for their services but they don't ask questions, and they'll airdrop the supplies at your location. If you make the Russians unhappy, though, you'll be locked out of the shop until you smooth things over.

Also, if you need some quick cash or want to improve your Mafia status, the chop-shop next to their headquarters is always open. They'll buy any vehicle that you bring in.BIN_H

The Supergun is a hardened structure, requiring a bunker buster or equally strong weapon to destroy. Additionally, the Supergun has an integrated jammer system. You'll have to find a way to destroy it without direct Allied air support.

Also, the area around the Supergun has been contaminated by radioactive materials used in its ammunition. Only shielded vehicles, such as an NK Tank, can safely cross these areas.

You get paid either way, but a kill is worth only half bounty, OK? Dead folks is bad TV - we like them alive, got it?

Alright, good luck, Merc. Come back and see us when you're done.
